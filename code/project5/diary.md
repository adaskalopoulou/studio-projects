MY IDEAL PROJECT PITCH

In a few decades, will we recognize the Mediterranean Sea as we know it today? Many scientists fear not. The invasion of alien marine species through shipping, fish farming, aquarium trade, but primarily through the Suez Canal (especially after its recent enlargement) endangers the unique biodiversity of the Mediterranean, batters its fisheries, and often threatens public health.
Species have always used the oceans to travel around the earth. But winds and currents were their only means of transportation, not allowing for movements of large magnitude and speed. The human factor is changing the rules, and climate change disturbs every possible balance. Species are not like Legos, removing a green brick and replacing it with a white one.
What if we could track these movements and impacts, and map the origins and the final destinations of the marine invasive species? The Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (http://www.griis.org/) keeps track of almost 100.000 of occurrences of alien species in different countries. But usually, knowing exactly where these species came from is almost impossible. If these data were available I would map the routes of the alien species around the world today, and use science-informed models to make future projections of invasions.
