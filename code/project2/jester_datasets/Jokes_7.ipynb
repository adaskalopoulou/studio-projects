The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes its an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows.

Now very interested, the boy replied, Yes, sir. Minutes later the girl came down the stairs, kissed her father goodbye and the couple left. After only a few minutes she reappeared, furious, dress torn, hair a mess and screamed, Dammit, Daddy, its the TWIST, get it straight!  \n",

After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br />This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:br />One chalk mark:$1.Knowing where to put it,$49,999.He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.  \n",

Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. Shes a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and Im afraid you cant marry her.William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, Dianne said yes! Were getting married in June.Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. Dianne is your half-sister too, William. Im awfully sorry about this.William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.Dad has done so much harm.I guess Im never going to get married, he complained. Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.His mother just shook her head. Dont pay any attention to what he says, dear. Hes not really your father.  \n",

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent Easy Reading to the original script.All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, An R! The scribes left out the R! A particularly concerned angel takes him aside, and offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what he means.After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, Its the letter R. They left out the R. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!  \n",

So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and theyre falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures--the whole thing is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what theyre trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. Isnt that just like an engineer? Were looking for the height and he gives us the length.  \n",

You bet, said the first, and with that, he ran over and said, Can you breathe? She shook her head no. He said, Can you speak? She again shook her head no. With that, he pulled up her skirt and licked her on the butt.She was so shocked, she coughed up the obstruction and began to breathe--with great relief.The redneck walked back to his friend and said, Funny how that hind lick maneuver always works.  \n",

Anybody caught breaking this rule will be finded $20 the first time. He continued, Anybody caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught a third time will cost you a fine of $180. Are there any questions?At this point, a male student in the crowd inquired:How much for a season pass?  \n",

Both of their vehicles were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one was hurt. In thankfulness, the woman said to the man, We are both okay, so we should celebrate. I have a bottle of wine in my car:lets open it. So the woman got the bottle out of the car, and handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink, and handed the woman the bottle.

St. Peter checks his dossier and says, Ah, youre an engineer--youre in the wrong place. So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, theyve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, So, hows it going down there in hell?Satan replies, Hey, things are going great. Weve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and theres no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.God replies, What?? Youve got an engineer? Thats a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.Satan says, No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and Im keeping him.God says, Send him back up here or Ill sue.Satan laughs uproariously and answers, Yeah, right.

All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you will hear exactly that!She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, Nelson. The radio responded, Ricky or Willie? She was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, thats what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it.She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying On the Road Again when the light turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying attention to the light.

You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.You must be an engineer, said the balloonist.I am, replied the woman. How did you know?Well, answered the balloonist, everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost. Frankly, youve not been much help so far.The woman below responded, You must be in management.I am, replied the balloonist, but how did you know?Well, said the woman, you dont know where you are or where you are going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect people beneath you to solve your problems.

       "126  A little boy goes to his dad and asks, What is politics?His dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way:Im the breadwinner of the family, so lets call me capitalism. Your Mom, shes the administrator of the money, so well call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so well call you the people. The nanny, well consider her the working class. And your baby brother, well call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nannys room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.  \n",

Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.Well, said the American, I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.Thats amazing! said the one of the doctors, But what happened to the other two?Last I saw them, replied the American, the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.  \n",
       "128    A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads:For Women Only. Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. Its easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you whats inside.So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads:All the men on this floor are short and plain. The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads:All the men here are short and handsome. Still, this isnt good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads:All the men here are tall and plain.They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect:All the men here are tall and handsome. The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads:There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.  \n",

He goes up to a nearby farm house for help, and because it is suppertime he is asked to stay for supper. When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg.As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg.Oh, says the farmer, that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just dont eat it all at once!  \n",

St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.The teacher answered quickly, That would be the Titanic. St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didnt really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder:How many people died on the ship?Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. 1,228, he answered.

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, I told them, President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.  "

Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.</td>\n",

Theyre almost out of gas, so Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of town. The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes its an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say goodbye.As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, Now arent you glad you married me and not him? You couldve been the wife of a grease monkey!To which Hillary replied, No, Bill. If I would have married him, youd be pumping gas and he would be the President!   \n",

Excuse me miss, but how do you get into your pants?Well, she replied, you can start by buying me a drink.   \n",

After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br />This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:br />One chalk mark:$1.Knowing where to put it,$49,999.He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.   \n",

Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. Shes a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and Im afraid you cant marry her.William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, Dianne said yes! Were getting married in June.Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. Dianne is your half-sister too, William. Im awfully sorry about this.William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.Dad has done so much harm.I guess Im never going to get married, he complained. Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.His mother just shook her head. Dont pay any attention to what he says, dear. Hes not really your father.   \n",

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent Easy Reading to the original script.All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, An R! The scribes left out the R! A particularly concerned angel takes him aside, and offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what he means.After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, Its the letter R. They left out the R. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!   \n",

So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and theyre falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures--the whole thing is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what theyre trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. Isnt that just like an engineer? Were looking for the height and he gives us the length.   \n",

Anybody caught breaking this rule will be finded $20 the first time. He continued, Anybody caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught a third time will cost you a fine of $180. Are there any questions?At this point, a male student in the crowd inquired:How much for a season pass?   \n",

Both of their vehicles were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one was hurt. In thankfulness, the woman said to the man, We are both okay, so we should celebrate. I have a bottle of wine in my car:lets open it. So the woman got the bottle out of the car, and handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink, and handed the woman the bottle.

St. Peter checks his dossier and says, Ah, youre an engineer--youre in the wrong place. So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, theyve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, So, hows it going down there in hell?Satan replies, Hey, things are going great. Weve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and theres no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.God replies, What?? Youve got an engineer? Thats a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.Satan says, No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and Im keeping him.God says, Send him back up here or Ill sue.Satan laughs uproariously and answers, Yeah, right.

All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you will hear exactly that!She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, Nelson. The radio responded, Ricky or Willie? She was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, thats what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it.She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying On the Road Again when the light turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying attention to the light.

You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.You must be an engineer, said the balloonist.I am, replied the woman. How did you know?Well, answered the balloonist, everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost. Frankly, youve not been much help so far.The woman below responded, You must be in management.I am, replied the balloonist, but how did you know?Well, said the woman, you dont know where you are or where you are going.

       "126  A little boy goes to his dad and asks, What is politics?His dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way:Im the breadwinner of the family, so lets call me capitalism. Your Mom, shes the administrator of the money, so well call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so well call you the people. The nanny, well consider her the working class. And your baby brother, well call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nannys room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.   \n",

Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.Well, said the American, I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.Thats amazing! said the one of the doctors, But what happened to the other two?Last I saw them, replied the American, the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.   \n",
       "128    A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads:For Women Only. Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. Its easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you whats inside.So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads:All the men on this floor are short and plain. The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads:All the men here are short and handsome. Still, this isnt good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads:All the men here are tall and plain.They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect:All the men here are tall and handsome. The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads:There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.   \n",

He goes up to a nearby farm house for help, and because it is suppertime he is asked to stay for supper. When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg.As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg.Oh, says the farmer, that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just dont eat it all at once!   \n",

Rumors of the sale (and some advertising in the local paper) were the main reason for the long line that formed by 8:00, the stores opening time, in front of the store.A small man pushed his way to the front of the line, only to be pushed back, amid loud and colorful curses. On the mans second attempt, he was punched square in the jaw, and knocked around a bit, and then thrown to the end of the line again. As he got up the second time, he said to the person at the end of the line.That does it! If they hit me one more time, I wont open the store!,   \n",

St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.The teacher answered quickly, That would be the Titanic. St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didnt really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder:How many people died on the ship?Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. 1,228, he answered. Thats right! You may enter.St. Peter turned to the lawyer:Name them.   \n",

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, I told them, President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.   \n",

In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br /&gt;This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.

Thats a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.Satan says, No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and Im keeping him.God says, Send him back up here or Ill sue.Satan laughs uproariously and answers, Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?</td>\n",

Your Mom, shes the administrator of the money, so well call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so well call you the people. The nanny, well consider her the working class. And your baby brother, well call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nannys room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.</td>\n",

St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.The teacher answered quickly, That would be the Titanic. St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didnt really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder:How many people died on the ship?Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. 1,228, he answered. Thats right! You may enter.St. Peter turned to the lawyer:Name them.</td>\n",

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, I told them, President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.</td>\n",

After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br />This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:br />One chalk mark:$1.Knowing where to put it,$49,999.He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.   \n",

Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. Shes a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and Im afraid you cant marry her.William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, Dianne said yes! Were getting married in June.Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. Dianne is your half-sister too, William. Im awfully sorry about this.William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.Dad has done so much harm.I guess Im never going to get married, he complained. Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.His mother just shook her head. Dont pay any attention to what he says, dear. Hes not really your father.   \n",

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent Easy Reading to the original script.All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, An R! The scribes left out the R! A particularly concerned angel takes him aside, and offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what he means.After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, Its the letter R. They left out the R. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!   \n",

So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and theyre falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures--the whole thing is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what theyre trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. Isnt that just like an engineer? Were looking for the height and he gives us the length.   \n",

Anybody caught breaking this rule will be finded $20 the first time. He continued, Anybody caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught a third time will cost you a fine of $180. Are there any questions?At this point, a male student in the crowd inquired:How much for a season pass?   \n",

Both of their vehicles were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one was hurt. In thankfulness, the woman said to the man, We are both okay, so we should celebrate. I have a bottle of wine in my car:lets open it. So the woman got the bottle out of the car, and handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink, and handed the woman the bottle.

St. Peter checks his dossier and says, Ah, youre an engineer--youre in the wrong place. So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, theyve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, So, hows it going down there in hell?Satan replies, Hey, things are going great. Weve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and theres no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.God replies, What?? Youve got an engineer? Thats a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.Satan says, No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and Im keeping him.God says, Send him back up here or Ill sue.Satan laughs uproariously and answers, Yeah, right.

All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you will hear exactly that!She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, Nelson. The radio responded, Ricky or Willie? She was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, thats what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it.She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying On the Road Again when the light turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying attention to the light.

You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.You must be an engineer, said the balloonist.I am, replied the woman. How did you know?Well, answered the balloonist, everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost. Frankly, youve not been much help so far.The woman below responded, You must be in management.I am, replied the balloonist, but how did you know?Well, said the woman, you dont know where you are or where you are going.

       "126  A little boy goes to his dad and asks, What is politics?His dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way:Im the breadwinner of the family, so lets call me capitalism. Your Mom, shes the administrator of the money, so well call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so well call you the people. The nanny, well consider her the working class. And your baby brother, well call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nannys room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.   \n",

Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.Well, said the American, I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.Thats amazing! said the one of the doctors, But what happened to the other two?Last I saw them, replied the American, the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.   \n",
       "128    A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads:For Women Only. Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. Its easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you whats inside.So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads:All the men on this floor are short and plain. The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads:All the men here are short and handsome. Still, this isnt good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads:All the men here are tall and plain.They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect:All the men here are tall and handsome. The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads:There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.   \n",

He goes up to a nearby farm house for help, and because it is suppertime he is asked to stay for supper. When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg.As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg.Oh, says the farmer, that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just dont eat it all at once!   \n",

Rumors of the sale (and some advertising in the local paper) were the main reason for the long line that formed by 8:00, the stores opening time, in front of the store.A small man pushed his way to the front of the line, only to be pushed back, amid loud and colorful curses. On the mans second attempt, he was punched square in the jaw, and knocked around a bit, and then thrown to the end of the line again. As he got up the second time, he said to the person at the end of the line.That does it! If they hit me one more time, I wont open the store!,   \n",

St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.The teacher answered quickly, That would be the Titanic. St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didnt really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder:How many people died on the ship?Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. 1,228, he answered. Thats right! You may enter.St. Peter turned to the lawyer:Name them.   \n",

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, I told them, President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.   \n",

They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br /&gt;This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.

Theyre almost out of gas, so Bill pulls into a service station on the outskirts of town. The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes its an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say goodbye.As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, Now arent you glad you married me and not him? You couldve been the wife of a grease monkey!To which Hillary replied, No, Bill. If I would have married him, youd be pumping gas and he would be the President!   \n",

You see that stone wall there? I built it with me own bare hands, placed every stone meself. But do they call me MacGregor the wall builder? No!He takes a few sips of his beer then says, Aye, and look out on that lake and eye that beautiful pier. I built it meself, laid every board and hammered each nail, but do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No!He continues:And lad, you see that road? That too I build with me own bare hands. Laid every inch of pavement meself, but do they call MacGregor the road builder? No!Again he returns to his beer for a few sips, and then says, Agh, but you screw one sheep.   \n",

After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed, but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small x in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated,br />This is where your problem is.The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:br />One chalk mark:$1.Knowing where to put it,$49,999.He was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.   \n",

Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. Shes a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and Im afraid you cant marry her.William was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, Dianne said yes! Were getting married in June.Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. Dianne is your half-sister too, William. Im awfully sorry about this.William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.Dad has done so much harm.I guess Im never going to get married, he complained. Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.His mother just shook her head. Dont pay any attention to what he says, dear. Hes not really your father.   \n",

After becoming a linguistic master, he sits down in the library and begins to pour over every version of the Bible, working back from most recent Easy Reading to the original script.All of a sudden there is a scream in the library. The angels come running in only to find the Pope huddled in his chair, crying to himself and muttering, An R! The scribes left out the R! A particularly concerned angel takes him aside, and offering comfort, asks him what the problem is and what he means.After collecting his wits, the Pope sobs again, Its the letter R. They left out the R. The word was supposed to be CELEBRATE!   \n",

So they go out to the flagpole with ladders and tape measures, and theyre falling off the ladders, dropping the tape measures--the whole thing is just a mess. An engineer comes along and sees what theyre trying to do, walks over, pulls the flagpole out of the ground, lays it flat, measures it from end to end, gives the measurement to one of the managers and walks away.After the engineer has gone, one manager turns to another and laughs. Isnt that just like an engineer? Were looking for the height and he gives us the length.   \n",

Anybody caught breaking this rule will be finded $20 the first time. He continued, Anybody caught breaking this rule the second time will be fined $60. Being caught a third time will cost you a fine of $180. Are there any questions?At this point, a male student in the crowd inquired:How much for a season pass?   \n",

Both of their vehicles were completely destroyed, buy fortunately, no one was hurt. In thankfulness, the woman said to the man, We are both okay, so we should celebrate. I have a bottle of wine in my car:lets open it. So the woman got the bottle out of the car, and handed it to the man. The man took a really big drink, and handed the woman the bottle.

St. Peter checks his dossier and says, Ah, youre an engineer--youre in the wrong place. So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, theyve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, So, hows it going down there in hell?Satan replies, Hey, things are going great. Weve got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and theres no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.God replies, What?? Youve got an engineer? Thats a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.Satan says, No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and Im keeping him.God says, Send him back up here or Ill sue.Satan laughs uproariously and answers, Yeah, right.

All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you will hear exactly that!She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, Nelson. The radio responded, Ricky or Willie? She was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, thats what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it.She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying On the Road Again when the light turned green and she pulled out. Suddenly an enormous sports utility vehicle coming from the street she was crossing sped toward her, obviously not paying attention to the light.

You are between 40 and 41 degrees north latitude and between 59 and 60 degrees west longitude.You must be an engineer, said the balloonist.I am, replied the woman. How did you know?Well, answered the balloonist, everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is, I am still lost. Frankly, youve not been much help so far.The woman below responded, You must be in management.I am, replied the balloonist, but how did you know?Well, said the woman, you dont know where you are or where you are going.

       "126  A little boy goes to his dad and asks, What is politics?His dad says, Well son, let me try to explain it this way:Im the breadwinner of the family, so lets call me capitalism. Your Mom, shes the administrator of the money, so well call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so well call you the people. The nanny, well consider her the working class. And your baby brother, well call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nannys room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. The father says, Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.The little boy replies, Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.   \n",

Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.Well, said the American, I remember the crash, and then there was a beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at the gate s of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all to young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to earth. So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing I knew I was back here.Thats amazing! said the one of the doctors, But what happened to the other two?Last I saw them, replied the American, the Scot was haggling over the price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay his.   \n",
       "128    A group of girlfriends is on vacation when they see a 5-story hotel with a sign that reads:For Women Only. Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in. The bouncer, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works. We have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there. Its easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you whats inside.So they start going up and on the first floor the sign reads:All the men on this floor are short and plain. The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. The sign on the second floor reads:All the men here are short and handsome. Still, this isnt good enough, so the friends continue on up. They reach the third floor and the sign reads:All the men here are tall and plain.They still want to do better, and so, knowing there are still two floors left, they continued on up. On the fourth floor, the sign is perfect:All the men here are tall and handsome. The women get all excited and are going in when they realize that there is still one floor left. Wondering what they are missing, they head on up to the fifth floor. There they find a sign that reads:There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.   \n",

He goes up to a nearby farm house for help, and because it is suppertime he is asked to stay for supper. When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg.As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg.Oh, says the farmer, that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just dont eat it all at once!   \n",

Rumors of the sale (and some advertising in the local paper) were the main reason for the long line that formed by 8:00, the stores opening time, in front of the store.A small man pushed his way to the front of the line, only to be pushed back, amid loud and colorful curses. On the mans second attempt, he was punched square in the jaw, and knocked around a bit, and then thrown to the end of the line again. As he got up the second time, he said to the person at the end of the line.That does it! If they hit me one more time, I wont open the store!,   \n",

St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it.The teacher answered quickly, That would be the Titanic. St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didnt really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder:How many people died on the ship?Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie. 1,228, he answered. Thats right! You may enter.St. Peter turned to the lawyer:Name them.   \n",

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, I told them, President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.   \n",
