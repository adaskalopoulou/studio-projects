## Profits and sets

Over the course of the last decades, the majority of the sets produced by LEGO were related to construction, exploration and occupations. However, the companyâ€™s profit declined significantly between 1994-2004. In 2004 Lego introduced toys that needed minor building skills and were targeted either to girls or boys. The graph below presents the profits of the company during the last two decades in relation to the number of different sets introduced, highlighting the set categories of which LEGO released the largest number of set variations.
